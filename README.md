**Rooted in Self-Trust, Guided by the Inner Compass**

A free and evolving resource hub for healing, mental wellness, and wholenessâ€”where lived experience meets research, and self-trust becomes the foundation for transformation.

## âœ¨ What This Is

**The Compass Within** is a quiet place on the web to:
- Explore mental health tools and worksheets
- Read personal reflections and stories from lived experience
- Access curated scientific findings in wellness and integrative care
- Reclaim direction through grounded resources, not noise

This is a solo project built on care, curiosity, and a belief in inner wisdom as a valid guide.

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
yarn
```

## Local Development

```bash
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
