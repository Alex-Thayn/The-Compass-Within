## âœ¨ What This Is

**The Compass Within** is a quiet place on the web to:
- Explore mental health tools and worksheets
- Read personal reflections and stories from lived experience
- Access curated scientific findings in mental health and integrative care
- Reclaim direction through grounded resources, not noise

This is a solo project built on care, curiosity, and a belief in inner wisdom as a valid guide.
