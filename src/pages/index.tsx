          <p>
            This space was created as a gentle return â€” to what matters, to whatâ€™s real, to the quiet knowing inside. 
            Itâ€™s not about fixing. Itâ€™s about integrating all parts of who we are and trusting the process.

            I built this because I needed it. And maybe you do too.
