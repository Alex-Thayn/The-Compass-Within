# The Polyvagal Theory

Stephen Porges' Polyvagal Theory explains how our nervous system shifts between regulation, fight/flight, and shutdown.

- Ventral Vagal: connection, safety
- Sympathetic: alert, fight/flight
- Dorsal Vagal: collapse, numbness

Understanding these states helps build compassion and self-regulation tools.
